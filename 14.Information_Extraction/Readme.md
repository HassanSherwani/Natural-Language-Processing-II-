# Problem Statement

It is tough to read and retrieve informarion manually from documents. So, this project is an attempt to automate this process.

# Content

- Notebook1: using bag of word + TFIDF
- Notebook2: applying tfidf and getting results evaluated titles, abstract, main text.
- Notebook3: Keeping TFIDF as main method but, Other techniques such as gensim TextRank summarization,RAKE(Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) ,Yet Another Keyword Extractor (Yake) ,python-based keyphrase extraction (pke), were explored.
- Notebook 4a: Using Topic Modeling methods, implementing information extraction from documents
- Notebook 4b: Extracting information from random documents using Topic Modeling concept. We have applied both BoW and TF-IDF as vectorization method.
