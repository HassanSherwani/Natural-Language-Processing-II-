    "    - In other words, X should be defined using either **all rows** or **only those rows with a confidence_mean of at least 0.75**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",
    "    - X should refer to either the **review column** or the **review_city column**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",

    "2. Build a document-term matrix (from X) called **X_dtm**, and examine its shape.\n",
    "3. Read the new comments stored in **`mcdonalds_new.csv`** into a DataFrame called **new_comments**, and examine it.\n",
    "4. If your model uses a **review_city** column, create that column in the new_comments DataFrame. (Otherwise, skip this step.)\n",

    "6. Train your best model (Naive Bayes or logistic regression) using **X_dtm** and **y**.\n",
    "7. Predict the \"rude probability\" for each comment in **new_dtm**, and store the probabilities in an object called **new_pred_prob**.\n",

I needed to use the restroom  facilities  and the women's bathroom didn't have soap, the floor was wet,  the bathroom stink, and the toilets were nasty. This McDonald's is very nasty. Houston   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this. na   \n",
