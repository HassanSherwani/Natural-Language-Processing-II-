After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.\n",

      "The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year.\n"
